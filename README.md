# Code samples
Just a repo I store solutions to problems I thought were interesting. Maybe I saw these during an interview, interview prep, or while building some personal project. They're mostly stand-alone programs which are individually documented.

I have tried to keep each of the implementations time-boxed to approximate an interview question. After the initial implementation, only cleaning-up and adding documentaiton.
